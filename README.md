# My very first Kaggle project, Lung Cancer Prediction for Kaggle Data Science Bowl

The first non-academia data science project. At the time, the code was not very well organized. Thought about re-organized a little bit, but it is not worth the time as it was already years old.

Keep as a record to remind myself how much I improve and grow over the past years.
